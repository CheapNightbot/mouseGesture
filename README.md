## Why ??

I've been using MS Edge (yes meow~) for so long and the "mouse gesture" feature there. And got very used to it. Like it is also very convenient where you are using mouse and scrolling through web
and then you need to go back or forward in history: *you need to move cursor all the way to the top left corner and click* (very inconvenient ~). But with gesture, wherever the cursuor is, just do
the gesture !!

So, if there's already such feature, why make this extension? The thing is, it only works in (and is specific feature of) MS Edge. And due to muscle memory, I found myself doing the same gesture thingy
in other browsers and end up messing things. Also, me noticed that this gesture thingy of MS Edge only works in Windows OS. Me tried in Linux, it doesn't ~work~ exist there. \_(:з)∠)\_
